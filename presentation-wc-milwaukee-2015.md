# Concepts

1. **What** are you going to sell?

^ What you're going to sell is so important. And it really is the first step in e-commerce. If you're selling an e-book part time on your blog you'll need a very different setup from someone who's planning on stocking thousands of items.

^ There's a lot to unpack here. What you're going to sell, who you're going to sell it to, how you're going to package and present that product, and so much more.
